## Getting Started
#### Run Project
Assumption that you have Node.js and npm installed
```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

#### What improvements would you make or best practices would you utilize if you had double the time?
 Currently, there's a bug where the search bar expands when overfilled with text, but it does not shrink back down when the text is deleted. I would like to fix this issue to make the resizing more dynamic. Additionally, I would like to improve the appearance of the 'I'm Feeling Lucky' button to make it look more like the original. Finally, I plan to add support for both Light and Dark modes.

If the site required more interactivity and API calls, I would have used a framework like React. I would also have been more diligent in breaking the site into components.

##### About how much time did you spend on the project?
About 6 hours. A significant portion of the time was spent setting up the environment. I added ESLint and pre-commit hooks to check the JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for SEO, performance, and accessibility issues.
